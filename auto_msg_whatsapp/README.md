### 1. Code Explanation:

pywhatkit: This library allows you to send WhatsApp messages using Python.

sendwhatmsg: This function sends a WhatsApp message to a specific phone number at a specified time.

* Parameters: 

Phone number (with country code, e.g., +91 for India).

Message to send.

Hour and minute (24-hour format) for scheduling the message.

### 2. How pywhatkit Works:

--> It opens WhatsApp Web in your default browser.

--> It logs in using the QR code from your WhatsApp account.

--> It sends the message at the specified time.

This means:

--> You cannot hide your identity as the sender.

--> The message is not truly anonymous.

### 3. Limitations of pywhatkit:

--> Not Anonymous: The message is sent from your WhatsApp account.

--> Requires Login: You must log in to WhatsApp Web using your phone.

--> Browser Automation: It relies on your browser, so it may fail if the browser crashes or if WhatsApp Web changes its interface.

--> Scheduling: The message is sent at a specific time, but it requires your computer to be on and the browser to be open.
